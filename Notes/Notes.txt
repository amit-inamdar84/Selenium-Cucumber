Dependency Injection (DI) containers - it simply tells a DI container to instantiate your step definition classes and wire them up correctly.
Pico container instantiated the required classes and hold the object throughout the program. Every scenario will get its own separate instance of
required objects.
Using Pico container we can eliminate the use of static, thread local etc.
